    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
      I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Product Designer and aspiring front-end
      developer with a strong interest in creating clean, user-friendly digital
      experiences. <p>
      <p> I enjoy turning ideas into functional and visually appealing
      interfaces using HTML and CSS, while paying close attention to usability,
      layout, and responsiveness across devices, accomadating more users. <p>
      <p> My background in UI/UX design has helped me
      develop a user-first mindset, allowing me to design interfaces that are
      both intuitive and purposeful. <p>
      <p> I’m continuously learning and improving my front-end skills, experimenting with modern design patterns, and building
      projects that challenge my creativity and technical understanding. <p> 
      
      <p> I’m motivated by growth, collaboration, and problem-solving, and I’m excited
      to keep expanding my skills while working on real-world projects that make
      a meaningful impact. <p>

      <p> Thank you for joining me in this journey, this is just the begining.</p>
